####Inspiration: 
#####Netflix 
#####https://www.netflix.com
######Positives- 
I like using Netflix because it is extremely streamlined. The layout feels very intuitive and it's easy to know what to do to get what you want. The look of the site is simple and is not distracting from the content. I also love that it only takes a few clicks to arrive at the end goal. Another feature that I really enjoy about Netflix is that each user has their individual profile, which keeps your information organized and separate from others that may also be using the same account. The final reason Netflix is an inspiration to me is their color scheme. They were able to take just two colors (black and red) and make a very iconic and bold look from them. 

######Negatives-
I do think there should be a separate section or category for which users can personally mark things they've already seen (even if they didn't watch it on Netflix). It's inconvenient to have content that would most likely not be relevant (user does not want to watch the same show again) clogging up the interface. If the user would want to watch the same show, they can look directly in the previously seen category to find it. 

#####Wikipedia
#####https://www.wikipedia.org/
######Positives-
I love Wikipedia because the hyperlinked words make it easy to discover new information. The links connecting the pages within the site aid with the flow of thought. I often find myself reading something which leads to another question and the relevant information to that new question is right there in front of me, waiting to be clicked. I also love that Wikipedia includes a table of content. It breaks down all of the information on the page near the top, so the user doesn't waste a large amount of time scrolling through unrelated or irrelevant information to get to what they want. 

######Negatives-
A downside to Wikipedia is that it's pretty ugly. It's stark white pages with walls of text and a couple images are boring. It's not a terrible thing as the purpose of Wikipedia is the information, but it could still be better.

#####reddit
#####https://www.reddit.com/
######Positives- 
I like reddit because the most popular posts appear at the top. This usually means you're being given quality or important content from the start. I also enjoy that they provide many tabs to sort content (hot, new, rising, controversial). reddit also allows individual users to customize categories, ensuring the content you see is relevant to the user. The last thing I enjoy about reddit's layout is that each piece of content has a thumbnail, which gives you a preview of what you're about to click on. Thumbnails often pique my interest in an article or picture that I wouldn't have clicked on otherwise.
######Negatives- 
The one things I dislike about reddit's design is that it takes time to become acclimated to the layout of the front page. The first time I came across reddit, I thought it was horribly ugly and overwhelming, so I exited out and didn't try it again for a long time. 
I also believe the comment section is clunky. It is sometimes hard to differentiate replies and original comments. It's also inconvenient that the user must click a new link (parent) to see who the comment is replying to.
